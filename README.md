# DS-4002-TA: Teaching Assistantship for Data Science Courses
This repository is the one I will be working on I wanted to go trough this on my own to ensure I am able to fully understand the assignments and projects in the course. I will be coming back here and updating any notes I have as I go through the course.
## A few Policies that will Govern the Class
Attendance Policy: The majority of the project work for this class is done during class. As such attendance is part of the course grade. Details are in the grading details page [Grading Policy](grading.md).

There are many additional policies that this course inherits from the School of Data Science course policies, please see [here](https://myuva-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/lpa2a_virginia_edu/EV_hHfKR8nxAissJQ5nxVEYB8wpCfQTej1YOnr-fzmgxQw?e=6yE1x1)
