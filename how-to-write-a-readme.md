Is a Hot Dog a Sandwich? (big header, like H1)

In this project we analyze whether a hot dog is a sandwich or not. We collected data from Undergraduates at UVA and analyzed it using Python.

Installation/Building (H2)

Show the actual commands I have to type to build the project, including fetching dependencies. Use Markdown triple-backticks ("```") to show commands in code style.

Usage (H2)

If it's a command-line app, list the available invocations (e.g. git revert, git commit, etc.). If it's a web app, list the URLS.

Notes (H2)

This is where you talk about your design ideas: algorithms, papers you've read, goals, TODO items.
